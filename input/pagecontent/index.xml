  <h3>Introduction</h3>
	<p>
    This implementation guide provides Morphine Milligram Equivalent (MME) calculation logic as described by the
    Centers For Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain — United
    States, 2016, hereafter referred to as the CDC Opioid Prescribing Guideline, or just <em>the Guideline</em>:
  </p>

  <p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/65/rr/rr6501e1.htm">CDC Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain</a></p>

  <p>The MME calculator is expressed using <a href="http://cql.hl7.org">Clinical Quality Language (CQL)</a>,
  and can be applied to Health Level 7 (HL7) <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir">Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR)</a>. A
  primary use case for this calculator is <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/65/rr/rr6501e1.htm#5_When_opioids_are_started">Recommendation #5</a>
  of the Guideline:</p>

<p>
    <strong>When opioids are started, providers should prescribe the lowest effective dosage.
    Providers should use caution when prescribing opioids at any dosage, should carefully
    reassess evidence of individual benefits and risks when considering increasing dosage
    to ≥50 morphine milligram equivalents (MME)/day, and should avoid increasing dosage
    to ≥90 MME/day or carefully justify a decision to titrate dosage to >90 MME/day
    <em>(recommendation category: A, evidence type: 3)</em>.</strong>
</p>

  <p>
    This implementation guide was developed based on work initially done as part of the
    <a href="https://confluence.hl7.org/display/CQIWC/Clinical+Quality+Framework">Clinical Quality Framework (CQF)</a>
    Initiative, a public-private partnership sponsored by the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) and
    the U.S. Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC) to identify, develop, and harmonize
    standards for clinical decision support and electronic clinical quality measurement, as well as a joint effort by
    the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT (ONC)
    focused on improving processes for the development of standardized, shareable, computable decision support artifacts
    using the CDC Opioid Prescribing Guideline as a model case.
  </p>

    Feedback and contributions are welcome and can be submitted using the New Issue link in the footer of every page. Discussions on the
    use of this IG as well as other CQF projects take place regularly on the <a href="https://confluence.hl7.org/display/CDS/CPGonFHIR">CPG-on-FHIR calls</a>,
    a subworkgroup of the HL7 Clinical Decision Support Workgroup.

  <a name="overview"> </a>
  <h3>Overview</h3>

  <p>
    The MME calculation information provided above is based on conversion factors for each of the various opioids.
    Due to the possibility of combination drugs, the component ingredients of a drug need to be considered in
    order to correctly determine the opioid ingredient strength. To determine this, the calculator requires
    drug component information to be available. This information can be determined using the <a href="https://rxnav.nlm.nih.gov/">RxNav Application Programming Interface (API)</a>.
    To avoid having to include a service call to this API during the calculation, the required information is
    cached according to the process described <a href="http://build.fhir.org/ig/cqframework/opioid-cds-r4/service-documentation.html#solution-component-1-medication-and-terminology-knowledge-base">here</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    That process results in a Microsoft Access database. Within Clinical Quality Language (CQL), that data can be accessed by defining a
    data model (using CQL <a href="https://cql.hl7.org/07-physicalrepresentation.html#data-model-references">ModelInfo</a>)
    and using that to retrieve data from that database. However, that approach would introduce a run-time dependency
    for the MME calculator that would then need to be distributed with the calculator, as well as require
    implementing systems to support access using this data model. To avoid this runtime dependency, the
    data are converted to a "pure" CQL expression, and distributed in the OMTKData CQL library.
  </p>

  <h3>Contents</h3>

  <p><a href="toc.html">Table of Contents</a></p>

  <p>
    The MME calculation logic is contained within four libraries:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><b><a href="Library-ConversionFactors.html">ConversionFactors</a></b> - Logic to determine appropriate conversion factor for a given ingredient, dose form, and dose quantity.</li>
    <li><b><a href="Library-OMTKData.html">OMTKData</a></b> - The RxNorm drug ingredient data required to determine the strength of individual ingredients within combination drugs.</li>
    <li><b><a href="Library-OMTKLogic.html">OMTKLogic</a></b> - The core MME calculator, expressed in pure CQL and independent of any particular data model</li>
    <li><b><a href="Library-MMECalculator.html">MMECalculator</a></b> - Logic to apply the MME calculator to FHIR R4 MedicationRequest resources</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Layering the calculator in this way enables it to be used with different data models. In particular, the calculator
    is being used with <a href="http://ecqi.healthit.gov/qdm">Quality Data Model</a> as part of the specification of a Potential Opioid Overuse electronic
    Clinical Quality Measure (eCQM), and as part of the computable representation of the CDC Opioid Prescribing Guideline in
    both <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/STU3">FHIR STU3</a> and <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/R4">FHIR R4</a> versions.
  </p>

  <p>
    Note that because FHIR implementation guides typically only target a single FHIR version, the canonical base and package id
    for this implementation guide include the `r4` designator to distinguish packages targeting FHIR R4.
  </p>

  <a name="data-elements"> </a>
  <h3>Data Elements</h3>

  <p>
    The FHIR R4 MME calculator only uses the MedicationRequest resource. To ensure proper functioning with this calculator,
    this implementation guide defines a MedicationRequest profile. Resources used with this calculator must conform to this
    profile in order to produce the expected results:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><a href="StructureDefinition-mmemedicationrequest.html">MMEMedicationRequest</a></li>
  </ul>

  <a name="usage"> </a>
  <h3>Usage</h3>

  <p>
    The calculator is intended to be used by referencing this content IG as a dependency, allowing the calculator
    to be referenced by including the MMECalculator in a CQL library:
  </p>

  <pre><code class="language-cql">library Example version '0.1.0'

using FHIR version '4.0.1'

include fhir.cdc."opioid-mme-r4".MMECalculator version '3.0.0'

context Patient

define TotalMME: MMECalculator.TotalMME([MedicationRequest])</code></pre>

  <p>
    This example library calls the <code>TotalMME</code> function of the <code>MMECalculator</code> library,
    passing the set of <code>MedicationRequest</code> resources for the patient in context. The calculator
    uses whatever medication requests it is given to calculate a total MME for a point-in-time. The calculator
    does not attempt to do any filtering of the medication requests it is given, that logic is the responsibility
    of the caller, so a production usage would of course include filtering to determine active medication requests.
  </p>

  <p>
    The result of the <code>TotalMME</code> expression is then a CQL <a href="https://cql.hl7.org/09-b-cqlreference.html#quantity"><code>Quantity</code></a> value, with
    units of <code>{MME}/d</code>, representing the combined Morphine Milligram Equivalent (MME) value of the input prescriptions.
  </p>

  <p>
    To use the MMECalculator in this way, declare this implementation guide as a dependency using the <code>dependsOn</code>
    element of the <code>ImplementationGuide</code> resource:
  </p>

  <pre><code class="language-xml">&lt;dependsOn&gt;
  &lt;packageId value=&quot;fhir.cdc.opioid-mme-r4&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;version value=&quot;dev&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/dependsOn&gt;</code></pre>

  <div class="info">
    <p>
      Note the use of the <code>dev</code> value for version. This value indicates that
      the version to be used is available locally. Until the Opioid MME calculator is published
      in a permanent site, this is the approach that must be taken because the publication tooling
      has no way to look up the required package listing.
    </p>
  </div>

  <a name="tests"> </a>
  <h3>Tests</h3>

  <p>
    To validate the functionality of the MME Calculator, this implementation guide includes test
    cases for a representative set of opioids for both the core calculator, as well as the FHIR R4
    calculator:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <!--<li><b><a href="Library-OMTKDataTests.html">OMTKDataTests</a></b> - Tests of the DrugIngredient Data.</li>-->
    <li><b><a href="Library-OMTKLogicTests.html">OMTKLogicTests</a></b> - Tests for the core MME calculator</li>
    <li><b><a href="Library-MMECalculatorTests.html">MMECalculatorTests</a></b> - Tests the FHIR r4 calculator</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The core calculator tests are expressed in pure CQL as expressions with expected result values. For example:
  </p>

  <pre><code class="language-cql">// 100 mg X (60 tablets/30 days) X 0.4 = 80 MME/day
  define TestDrug_Tapentadol: {
    rxNormCode: Code '1148797' from OMTKLogic.RXNORM display '12 HR tapentadol 100 MG Extended Release Oral Tablet',
    doseQuantity: 1 '{tab}',
    dosesPerDay: 2.0,
    mme: 80 '{MME}/d'
  }</code></pre>

  <p>
    This test indicates that for the drug '12 HR tapentadol 100 MG Extended Release Oral Tablet',
    prescribed at 2 tablets per day, the expected result is 80 '{MME}/d'.
  </p>

  <p>
    See the CQL content of the <a href="Library-OMTKLogicTests.html#cql-content">OMTKLogicTests</a> library
    for a complete description of the tests.
  </p>

  <p>
    Tests for the FHIR R4 MME calculator involve test MedicationRequest resources, contained in the <code>tests</code> folder
    of the source for this implementation guide:
  </p>

  <pre><code>input
  |-- tests
        |-- MMECalculatorTests // This folder is the same name as the library under test
              |-- patient-mme-greater-than-fifty // Folders at this level are named the same as the id of the patient under test
                    |-- Patient // Folders at this level are the name of the resource type in the test
                          |-- patient-mme-greater-than-fifty.json // The patient resource as a JSON file
                    |-- MedicationRequest
                          |-- example-rec-05-mme-greater-than-fifty-context.json // The medication request resource as a JSON file
              |-- patient-mme-less-than-fifty
                    |-- Patient
                    |-- MedicationRequest
                    |-- ...
              |-- ... // more test cases can be added by adding to this list</code></pre>
